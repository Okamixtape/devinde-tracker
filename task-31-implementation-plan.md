# Task 31 - UI Implementation Plan

Based on the analysis of design mockups in the `/design` folder and the standardized interfaces from Task 38, this document outlines our implementation approach.

## 1. Core Component Implementation

- [x] Create `ErrorBoundary` for isolating component errors
- [x] Implement `AppLayout` based on `MainLayout.tsx` design
- [ ] Create `PageHeader` with title and action buttons pattern
- [ ] Implement responsive `Sidebar` with toggle functionality

### UI Components
- [x] Create `Input` with validation and error handling
- [ ] Create `Button` with variants (primary, secondary, icon)
- [ ] Implement `Card` with header, body, footer structure
- [ ] Create `Tabs` component for content navigation
- [ ] Implement `Modal` for forms and dialogs
- [ ] Create `Table` for data display
- [ ] Implement `ProgressBar` for status visualization
- [ ] Create `Badge` for status indicators

### Data Display Components
- [ ] Implement `Chart` for data visualization

## 7. Testing and Validation

- [ ] Create unit tests for core components
- [ ] Implement integration tests for business components
- [ ] Add tests for page components and routing
- [ ] Validate responsive behavior across device sizes

## Implementation Sequence

1. Complete core layout and foundational UI components
2. Implement core business components with mock data
3. Add context providers and service integration
4. Connect adapters to standardized interfaces
5. Implement page components with full integration
6. Add validation, error handling, and edge cases
7. Finalize responsive behavior and polish UI

## Design Pattern Application

- Follow SOLID principles as established in architecture
- Use dependency injection for services
- Implement container/presentational component pattern
- Leverage composition for component reuse
- Apply adapter pattern for data transformation
- Use error boundaries and context for error management

## Performance Considerations

- Implement code splitting for page components
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Apply virtualization for long lists
- Optimize render performance with React.memo
- Create separate bundles for each major feature
