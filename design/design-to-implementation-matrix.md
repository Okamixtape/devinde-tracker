# Design to Implementation Matrix

This document maps the design mockups in the `/design` folder to our standardized component architecture, identifying integration points with standardized interfaces and recurring design patterns.

## Component Mapping

| Design Component | Implementation Component | Standardized Interfaces | Core UI Components |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| `MainLayout.tsx` | `components/core/Layout/AppLayout.tsx` | N/A | Header, Sidebar, ResponsiveContainer |
| `Dashboard.tsx` | `components/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` | `useBusinessPlan`, `useActionPlan`, `useFinancialProjects` | Card, ProgressBar, MetricDisplay |
| `BusinessModel.tsx` | `components/pages/BusinessModelPage.tsx` | `useBusinessModel` | Form, Tabs, Canvas |
| `FinancialDashboard.tsx` | `components/pages/FinancialDashboardPage.tsx` | `useFinancialProjects` | Chart, Table, Tabs |
| `ActionPlanTimeline.tsx` | `components/pages/ActionPlanPage.tsx` | `useActionPlan` | Timeline, Card, Form |
| `MarketAnalysis.tsx` | `components/pages/MarketAnalysisPage.tsx` | `useMarketAnalysis` | Form, Card, Modal |

## Recurring Design Patterns

1. **Page Structure**
   - Header with title and action buttons
   - Tabbed navigation for content sections
   - Responsive grid layouts (grid-cols-X)
   - Card-based content organization

2. **Component Patterns**
   - Cards with header, body, and footer sections
   - Data visualization (charts, progress bars)
   - Status indicators with color coding
   - Expandable/collapsible sections
   - Modal forms for data entry
   - Search and filter controls

3. **UI Elements**
   - Action buttons with icons
   - Status badges with contextual colors
   - Progress bars for completion indicators
   - Icon-based categorization
   - Form controls with consistent styling

4. **State Management Patterns**
   - Tab selection state
   - Modal/form visibility state
   - Edit/view modes for data
   - Form data handling
   - Filter and search state

## Integration with Standardized Interfaces

### 1. MainLayout.tsx
- Implements core layout without relying on specific business interfaces
- Will be extended by AppLayout component to provide error boundary integration

### 2. Dashboard.tsx
- Requires integration with:
  - `useBusinessPlan` for plan section data
  - `useActionPlan` for milestone progress
  - `useFinancialProjects` for revenue projections
  - `useMarketAnalysis` for segments data

### 3. BusinessModel.tsx
- Requires integration with:
  - `useBusinessModel` for model canvas data
  - Data operations for CRUD actions on business model components

### 4. FinancialDashboard.tsx
- Requires integration with:
  - `useFinancialProjects` for revenue, expense, and project tracking
  - Data visualization components for charts and metrics

### 5. ActionPlanTimeline.tsx
- Requires integration with:
  - `useActionPlan` for milestone and task management
  - Form handling for milestone/task creation
  - Status tracking and categorization

### 6. MarketAnalysis.tsx
- Requires integration with:
  - `useMarketAnalysis` for segments, competitors, trends
  - Data operations for CRUD on analysis components
  - Modal/form handlers for data entry

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Core Component Layer**
   - Create foundational UI components based on recurring patterns:
     - Button, Card, Form, Modal, Tabs, Table, ProgressBar
     - Consistent styling and behavior across components

2. **Business Component Layer**
   - Implement business domain components integrating standardized interfaces:
     - BusinessModelCanvas, FinancialChart, ActionPlanTimeline
     - Each component connects to corresponding hooks and services

3. **Page Component Layer**
   - Assemble pages following layouts from design mockups
   - Integrate error handling and loading states
   - Connect business components with appropriate context providers

4. **Service Integration**
   - Use adapters from Task 38 to connect with standardized interfaces
   - Implement data transformation between UI and service models

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Core Layout and Navigation**
   - `AppLayout` based on `MainLayout.tsx` design
   - Navigation components and responsive behavior

2. **Dashboard Overview**
   - Key metrics and progress indicators
   - Section navigation to other modules

3. **Business Module Components**
   - Business Model Canvas implementation
   - Financial components
   - Action Plan management
   - Market Analysis tools

4. **Data Visualization Components**
   - Charts, graphs, and progress visualizations
   - Status indicators and metrics displays

5. **Form Components**
   - Data entry and editing interfaces
   - Validation and error handling
