  - Follows the same pattern as BusinessModelAdapter with comprehensive transformation methods
  
- **React Hooks**:
  - `useFinances`: Single hook providing complete access to financial functionality
  - Includes filtering and statistical calculations
  - Maintains proper data structure and transformations

### Planned Next Migrations ðŸ”„

#### Strategic Direction Update
After careful consideration and analysis, we're adopting a more strategic approach to service standardization. Rather than standardizing all services, we'll focus on the most critical ones while beginning architectural work for the UI layer.

Please see our [Standardization Lessons Learned](docs/lessons-learned-standardization.md) and [UI Architecture Principles](docs/ui-architecture-principles.md) for details on this strategic shift.

#### Phase 1 (High Priority): Critical Infrastructure Services âœ…

- **ErrorService**: Improves error handling across the application âœ… 
  - Analysis: [Error Service Analysis](docs/error-service-analysis.md)
  - Implementation: [Error Service Implementation](docs/task-38.5-error-service-implementation.md)
  - Testing: Comprehensive tests in place
  - Status: Ready for review and demo
  
- **UI Prototype Components**: Example implementation of UI architecture principles âœ…
  - Implementation: [UI Error Handling Components](docs/ui-prototype-error-handling.md)
  - Components: `ErrorBoundary`, `ErrorDisplay`, `ErrorContainer`, `useErrorHandling` hook
  - Demo Component: `ExampleUsage.tsx` showcasing integration
  - Testing: Unit tests for all components
  - Status: Ready for review and demo
  
- **Demo & Documentation**: Validation approach âœ…
  - Prepared [Demo Instructions](docs/demo-instructions.md) for the team
  - Created extensive tests for validation
  - Documented approach for upcoming presentation

- **HttpService**: Core communication service for API requests
  - To be started after validation of ErrorService approach
  - Will follow same standardization pattern if approved
  - Testing plan: [Integration Testing Plan](docs/integration-testing-plan.md)

#### Phase 2 (Medium Priority)
- **SearchService**: Enhances user experience 
- **UIAdapterService**: UI component adapters
- **I18nService**: Internationalization functionality

### Testing and Verification âœ…

To ensure the migration process doesn't break existing functionality, we've created:
- [Integration Testing Plan](docs/integration-testing-plan.md): Verifies interactions between services
- [Next Services Migration Plan](docs/next-services-migration-plan.md): Identifies services related to business plans

### Bug Fixes and Refactoring ðŸ”§

As part of the ongoing standardization effort, we've fixed some issues:
- [Import Error Fix](docs/bug-fixes/action-plan-adapter-import-fix.md): Corrected import errors related to standardized enum types in multiple files

## Migration Pattern

To facilitate consistent and maintainable migration of services, we've established the following pattern:

### 1. Interface Definition

- Create a well-defined interface in `src/app/services/interfaces/service-interfaces.ts`
- Include complete JSDoc documentation for all methods
- Ensure proper typing for parameters and return values
- Define clear contracts that follow interface segregation principles

### 2. Interface Re-Export

- Create a dedicated type-only file for each interface (e.g., `IRiskClientService.ts`)
- Use TypeScript's `export type` to re-export the interface from `service-interfaces.ts`
- This creates a cleaner import experience while centralizing interface definitions

### 3. Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// 1. Import the interface and necessary dependencies
import { IExampleService } from './interfaces/service-interfaces';

// 2. Define a class implementation
class ExampleServiceImpl implements IExampleService {
  // Implement all interface methods
  // Use JSDoc documentation for all methods
  // Follow SOLID principles
}

// 3. Create singleton instance
export const ExampleService = new ExampleServiceImpl();

// 4. Export both instance and implementation class
export { ExampleServiceImpl };

// 5. Default export the singleton instance
export default ExampleService;
```

### 4. Migration Benefits

- **Backward Compatibility**: Singleton pattern ensures existing code continues to work
- **Better Testing**: Implementation class can be used for mocking and testing
- **Dependency Injection**: Implementation class supports DI patterns
- **Clear Contracts**: Interface defines the service contract separate from implementation
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments provide clear guidance on usage

## Next Steps

### Planned Migrations (Revised Priority)

#### Phase 1 (High Priority)
- **SectionService**: Critical for business plan functionality
- **BusinessPlanUIService**: (if exists) UI interactions with business plans
- Other services directly related to business plans

#### Phase 2 (Medium Priority)
- **SearchService**: Enhances user experience
- **ErrorService**: Improves error handling
- **UIAdapterService**: (if exists) UI component adapters

#### Phase 3 (Lower Priority)
- **AuthService**: Authentication functionality
- **HttpService**: API communication
- Other utility services

### Future Enhancements

- Replace direct storage access with storage abstractions
- Enhance error handling with standardized error types
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Consider implementing a proper DI container
