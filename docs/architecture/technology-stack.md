## Technology Selection Justification

### 1. Next.js as Application Framework
Next.js was selected for its robust server-side rendering capabilities, built-in routing, and strong developer ecosystem. The file-based routing system simplifies application organization, while the framework's built-in optimizations enhance performance. As a React-based framework, it leverages existing React knowledge within the team.

### 2. React Context and Hooks for State Management
For an application of this size and complexity, Redux or other state management libraries would introduce unnecessary overhead. React Context with custom hooks provides a clean, maintainable approach to state management that integrates naturally with the React component lifecycle.

### 3. LocalStorage for Data Persistence
The decision to use localStorage for data persistence was based on the requirements for offline functionality and the desire to avoid backend infrastructure. This approach enables users to work with their business plan data entirely in the browser, with options to export and import data when needed. For future scalability, this could be extended to include a backend sync mechanism.

### 4. Tailwind CSS for Styling
Tailwind CSS was chosen for its utility-first approach, which accelerates development while maintaining consistency. The framework's responsive utilities and PurgeCSS integration ensure optimal production builds with minimal CSS footprint.

### 5. TypeScript for Type Safety
TypeScript enhances code quality and developer experience through static typing, enabling better IDE support, self-documenting code, and safer refactoring. The benefits of catching errors at compile-time outweigh the slight increase in development complexity.

## Long-term Viability Considerations

All selected technologies have strong community support, active development, and are widely adopted in the industry. The stack represents a balance between cutting-edge capabilities and proven stability.

For future expansion, this stack would easily accommodate:
- Server components and API routes (via Next.js)
- Database integration (via Next.js API routes)
- Authentication systems (compatible with Next.js Auth patterns)
- Real-time capabilities (could be added via Socket.io or similar)

This technology stack aligns with modern web development practices while remaining accessible to developers with React experience.
