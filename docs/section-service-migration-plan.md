# SectionService Migration Plan

## Current Analysis

The SectionService is a critical component that manages sections within business plans. It has several unique characteristics:

1. It already implements an interface (`SectionService`) from `serviceInterfaces.ts`
2. It's implemented as a class (unlike some of the other services we've migrated)
3. It has a dependency on BusinessPlanServiceImpl 
4. Sections are not stored independently but as part of business plans

## Migration Approach

Based on the analysis, here's the plan for migrating the SectionService:

### 1. Interface Updates

- Verify that the `SectionService` interface in `service-interfaces.ts` follows our standardized naming convention (rename to `ISectionService` if needed)
- Ensure all methods have proper JSDoc documentation
- Add any missing method signatures that exist in the implementation but not in the interface

### 2. Implementation Adjustments

- Update the implementation class to implement the renamed interface (if applicable)
- Implement dependency injection pattern to make the service more testable
- Consider adding a factory method for creating the service
- Ensure singleton pattern is properly implemented

### 3. Integration

- Create an export file for the interface (`ISectionService.ts`)
- Update all imports across the application to use the new interface
- Ensure backward compatibility during the transition

## Implementation Steps

1. Examine the current `SectionService` interface in `serviceInterfaces.ts`
2. Create standardized `ISectionService` interface with proper documentation
3. Create type-export file for the interface
4. Adjust the implementation to implement the interface
5. Implement singleton pattern consistent with other services
6. Update imports across the application

## Considerations

- The SectionService depends on BusinessPlanServiceImpl, which means we need to ensure the dependency is properly managed
- The service has complex methods dealing with section creation, updating, and reordering, which need careful attention during migration
- This service is critical for business plan functionality, so thorough testing will be required after migration

## Testing Strategy

After migration, we should:

1. Test creating a new section in a business plan
2. Test updating a section's completion status
3. Test retrieving sections for a business plan
4. Test section reordering
5. Test that section visualization in the UI continues to work properly

## Timeline

This migration should be prioritized as part of Phase 1 due to its critical role in business plan functionality.

- Interface preparation: 1 day
- Implementation migration: 1-2 days
- Testing: 1 day
- Documentation: 0.5 day
