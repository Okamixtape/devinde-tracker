# Task Master Update

## Task 38: Standardize interfaces and implementations - Status Update

### Current Status: In Progress (Phase 1 Complete)

### Subtasks completed:

#### 38.1 Migrate business components
- âœ… BusinessPlanService
- âœ… React hooks for core business functionality

#### 38.2 Migrate service components
- âœ… RiskClientService
- âœ… DocumentService
- âœ… PaymentService

#### 38.3 Migrate business plan services
- âœ… SectionService
- Created standardized interface with documentation
- Implemented backward compatibility

#### 38.4 Migrate infrastructure components (partially complete)
- âœ… LocalStorageService
- âœ… ErrorService
- ðŸ”„ Evaluation of other infrastructure services pending demo feedback

#### 38.5 Strategic pivot to UI architecture
- âœ… Developed UI architecture principles document
- âœ… Created prototype UI components following SOLID principles:
  - ErrorBoundary
  - ErrorDisplay
  - ErrorContainer
  - useErrorHandling hook
- âœ… Created working demonstration with ExampleUsage component
- âœ… Developed comprehensive test suite for validation

### Current Work Products:

1. **New interfaces**:
   - `IStorageService`
   - `ILocalStorageService`
   - `ISectionService`
   - `IErrorService`

2. **Updated implementations**:
   - `LocalStorageServiceImpl`
   - `SectionServiceImpl`
   - `ErrorServiceImpl`

3. **UI Components**:
   - `ErrorBoundary`
   - `ErrorDisplay`
   - `ErrorContainer`

4. **Documentation**:
   - `ui-architecture-principles.md`
   - `lessons-learned-standardization.md`
   - `task-38.5-error-service-implementation.md`
   - `ui-prototype-error-handling.md`
   - `demo-instructions.md`

### Next Steps:

1. **Demo and review** the completed components with the team
2. Based on feedback:
   - Finalize ErrorService migration (rename .ts.new file)
   - Proceed with HttpService standardization OR
   - Focus on UI architecture implementation

3. **Documentation updates**:
   - Update architecture diagrams to reflect new standardized approach
   - Prepare training materials for the team on new patterns

### Velocity Assessment:

- The project has made significant progress in standardizing critical services
- The strategic pivot to focus on high-value components has accelerated delivery
- The approach of standardizing core infrastructure while prototyping UI architecture provides maximum business value

### Resource Requirements:

- Code review from 2-3 team members
- Time for team demo (30-45 minutes)
- Discussion and feedback session (30 minutes)

### Dependencies:

- Approval of the ErrorService approach before proceeding with HttpService
- Feedback on UI architecture prototype before expanding to other UI components
